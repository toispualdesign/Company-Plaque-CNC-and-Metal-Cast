# Company-Plaque-CNC-and-Metal-Cast
Project to make a castable mold for a car company logo via Shopbot CNC machine.


This was a continuation of a project a previous exchange student from my school began at the beginning of the year, and I carried forth from where they left off.

A metalworking company in Ã¾ingeyri had gotten a donation of metal from a car rental company, and wanted to gift them with a metal plaque based on the company logo. The first iteration of the mold was a little unclear on some parts and as a project to learn the CNC machine I set out to work on the logo to produce a mold that could be used.

Picture contents as follows:
T01 - Picure of the company logo and the basis on the model.
T02-04 - Various carve tests I did with the Shopbot with different RPM and feed speeds. In the end I decided to go with 18 000 RPM,
and 60 mm/sec feed rate. Tools used were 1/8 pocket tool for the flat areas, and a 90~ degree v-bit for the picture and text areas.
Major problem carving the logo was that a LOT of the time certain letters broke off partially or entirely. I used these more difficult letters as the test basis. For the final mold I also decided to do the letters on 3 cutting paths that went a little deeper each time. Also compared to the first prototype mold made by the previous intern, we decided to make the mold slightly bigger to make the details clearer. I also modified the car image further to make some details stand out a bit more with the final mold.
T05 - Final mold.
T06 - Showing the results to the "client" to see whether they are satisfied and wish to proceed with a cast.
T07 - They were! So here goes. First side of the cast frame has been filled, second level is installed here.
T08 - Second side is filled, a peg is added to keep a channel clear for pouring of the metal.
T09 - Two halves separated with the imprint of the mold visible. Graphite powder has been added between to separate the halves easier.
T10 - The setup for smelting the metal. Smaller project, so the large furnace wasn't used.
T11 - All of the metal used at the shop is recycled.
T12 - The prepared sand molds with funnels to help direct the metal.
T13 - The smelting is approaching the final stages. When adding new pieces of metal, they were heated up prior, in order to burn away any possible oil residues.
T14 - Adding sand around the molds in case any liquid metal tries to escape.
T15 - Flux in powder form. To make the smelted metal more flowy.
T16 - All ready for use!
T17, T18 - Pouring it in the molds.
T19 - Excess metal is poured into quare holes to have them in ingot form for later use.
T20 - The molds lacked air vents, so the metal didn't flow into the empty space as well as it could've.
T21 - Photos of new attempt made later. Much better, but there are still a few smaller holes. The models seem to be functional though.
